# My Journey

I started out as a YouTuber in 2019. I was about 8 and I was using my dad's devices to make YouTube videos, of course my dad was there to support me. Eventually, I kinda got bored and GAVE UP. Then, in 2024, I decided to open another channel, and things were starting to work out but my journey is just getting started. I hope you join as part of my journey as i become a better animator and I also hope to help you guys along the way.
